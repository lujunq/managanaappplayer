<b>MANAGANA</b>

Managana is a free cross-platform software for digital publication based on imagination as interface. Created by the Ciclope atelier, it allows the creation and maintenance of communities that share interactive content on the web, tablets, smartphones and exhibits. Each community has interactive streams composed of clusters of audiovisual, graphics, text and external feeds. Managana mixes and sequences play lists that can be created, displayed, and animated in the software itself.

<br /><b>LICENSE</b>

Managana is licensed under the LGPL v3 terms.

<br /><b>CODE</b>

Managana source code is split among its various modules. All the related repositories contain a FlashDevelop (www.flashdevelop.org) project ready to be build. Managana uses the Apache Flex SDK (flex.apache.org) instead of the Adobe one.

To build any Managana project you'll need to add the Ciclope AS3 classes (https://github.com/lujunq/ciclopeas3) to your classpath. You'll also need the old, but still very good Caurina tweener classes - the "as3" version (https://code.google.com/p/tweener/). Tweener is licensed under the "MIT License".
